# In GVCNN, the shape descriptor comes from the output of group fusion module,
# which is more representative than the view descriptor extracted from single view.
# And we directly use it for 3D shape retrieval.
#
# For two 3D shape X and Y , x and y is the shape descriptor extracted from GVCNN.
# Concretely, we use Euclidean distance between two 3D shapes in retrieval.
# d(X, Y ) = kx âˆ’ yk 2

# We further adopt a low-rank Mahalanobis metric.
# We learn a Mahalanobis metric W that directly projects GVCNN descriptors to a new space,
# in which the intra-class distance is smaller and inter-class distance is larger.
